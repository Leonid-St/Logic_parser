# Truth-Table-Generator
It genreates the truth table for the boolean expressions

# Working
      *   Expressions are first converted the precedance preserved - EVALUATION PLAN
      *   The working of this algorithm is different from the typical algorithm fo expression evaluation
      *   Then it elimiates duplicates by storing them in DICTIONARIES
      *   Next, it increases the number of combination rows depending on the no of unique independant variables
      *   Alongside, this the evaluation of the plan to generate the results takes place
      *   Finally, a fully sorted results TRUTH-TABLE is generated in a DATAGRID
      *   THe evaluation plan can also be obtanined from the query - using which the user himself can produce the truth table
